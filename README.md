# dsml-projects
Repository for Data Science / Machine Learning (DSML) projects I did for fun, exploring different ideas and challenges.

Some of the previous more "random" things I did are located [here](https://github.com/gsam1/my-ipython-notebooks).

## Motivation 
I wanted to do have a more structured repo for the projects I want to do, besides just randomly throwing them into jupyter notebooks into a repo.
By structered I mean that I have a list of projects that I want to do and all of them will explore different aspects of handling data.

The topics for each project will be different and the work will be stored in a jupyter notebook and the equivalent in R.

## Structure
This will change if something else comes to mind, but for now it is as follows:
1. Data Cleaning
    * 2 Projects - one in Python, one in R
    * Messy dataset
2. Data Scraping/Mining
    * One project in Python
    * Gather the dataset myself.
3. Data Storytelling
    * 2 Projects - one in Python and one in R.
    * More geared towards data visiualizations.
4. End-to-End Project
    * Make a prediction system with a dynamic dataset pulled from an api or scraped.
5. Different Machine Learning Algorithm showcases that come to mind.

## Comments on the project
1. Data_Cleaning
    * With Python - This... has taken a life on its own. I think I've made a lot of mistakes in assuming things, but for the sake of fooling around with *real* data I will go on.
    * With R - Although not a *classic* sense a cleaning data project - as no linking with other data sets was done I managed to answer the questions I wanted. However, the more I dig in the data the more thing I come up with...
2. Data Acquisition
    * Python - Settled on scraping the 'DVD and Streaming' section of Rotten Tomatoes, while crosschecking it with the genres in IMDB. The goal is to see the difference between the critic score and the viewer score by genre. I found relatively interesting the differences between critics and viewer scores for the genres, as well as what happened during the years.
3. Data Storytelling
    * Python - Chose to explore the 'Telco Customer Churn' and create a profile for the customer that most likely will leave.
4. End-to-End Project
5. Playground
    * Python - Various undertakings and playground with data.
